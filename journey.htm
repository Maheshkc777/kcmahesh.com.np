            <p class="h1" >My Journey</p>
            <p>When i was in Grade 5, I have a dream to be Doctor in the future.As we all know that thought changes with the time change.After 2 years in the school level in Grade 7 i have learnt many things about the computer. Many things that can be done by the help of the computer.Our Computer teacher .<u><b>"MR.Deepak Chaudhary"</b></u> teaches about the HTML in the school level. I have got many ideas.Like as me there is the boy whose Name is Nishan Subedi, Who is my closest friend .We are bery querious to learn many things about the HTML and we asked with our respected Deepak Sir.He told us that this is the basic program without it we can not make the webpage.We asked him about the program and its use ,He told us it is the basic and there are many other language too which is use to build the website and develop the application.
          We both me and my closest friend are excited about that. On our leasure period we met with our computer teacher to learn something. He teaches many things that is not related to the subject matter.</p>
          <p>After that we think to establish the website name start with <b>"Technologysite2075.com"</b>We have created the Gmail,Facebook ID and FaceBook Page on that name but Due to the exam pressure we can't complete. We focused on the study, we think that we will complete after the exam but the <b>CORONA Pandemic</b> has created the problem.We can't continue because we don't have the proper device.We Left our Project.</p>
          <p>
            On grade 12 I have discuss about the College website with the computer teacher <b>"MR.Birendra Kumar Yadav"</b>, I told him that we will make another website ,he say okey .After that we say if the website that is created by Me and My new Friend Sumit approved by the college addministration then that will be publish On the internet.Our computer Teacher say okey that a great Idea.
          </p>
           <p> My friend <b>"Nishan Subedi</b> help me in every problem. Now he is not with me because he has choosen different college For Further study. He used to stay in the hostel. He contact me when he has a cell-phone. Me make laugh each other and share our Past habbit.</p>
